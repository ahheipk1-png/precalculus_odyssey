# Star-System Map & Hub Destinations

← [docs orchestra](README.md)

The walkable hub + its destinations. Each is a self-contained module that renders into an
initially-empty `#…View` container and toggles views the `openShop`-style way. Every cross-module
call is `typeof`-guarded. (The master plan reframes this hub as **"Earth"** with a global "Go Back
to Earth" button — Phase 1.)

## Map / Earth hub — `js/15-map.js` (`#mapView`)

An avatar walks the path to a clicked building, then it opens: **Practice Hall** (back to the
equation), **Weapon Store** (`openShop`), **Item Store**, **Hotel**, **Wonderland**, **Farm**,
**Laboratory**, **Trading Room**. Each building's `WMAP_SPOTS` entry carries a `desc`, rendered as a
hover `title` (+ `aria-label`). The Star Atlas was removed from the hub (still on the global header
nav). Entry: the **🗺️ Map** button in the equation view. `openMapHub`/`closeMapHub`.
**Hotel:** a full HP+MP restore for `hotelCost()` = **15 × level** Cash (`hotelSleep`) — now the main
way to heal, since combat wounds persist (see rpg-combat-economy.md).

## Victory chest — `js/16-chest.js` (overlay)

`showVictoryChest(loot, cashReward)` after every battle — tap-to-open, sparkles, reward chips. Pure
presentation (rewards already credited by the caller); re-entrant; reduced-motion aware.

## Wonderland — `js/17-wonderland.js` (`#wonderlandView`)

Carnival lobby showing **🎟️ Wonderland Passes** + a playable **Tile Ball** (Breakout) canvas game
costing 1 pass. `wonderRewardForScore(f)` (pure) pays materials + an item by cleared fraction;
`applyWonderReward` credits them. The rAF loop is cancelled on exit.

**Hoo Hey How** (`js/27-hoohey.js`, `#hooHeyView`) — Bầu Cua dice betting for Cash. Bet on the six
symbols, then three dice roll: each match pays your stake back **plus** the same again. The roll is
**animated** — `hhRoll` decides the final faces up front, sets `_hhRolling`, and runs a 90 ms interval
that tumbles random symbols on the three `.hh-die-rolling` faces (shake keyframes) while the Roll
button is disabled; after ~1.15 s a `setTimeout` reveals the final dice (`.hh-die-land` pop-in) and
tags the row `.hh-dice-{win|lose|even}` + the result line `.hh-result-{…}` for the win/lose reaction
(`_hhOutcome`). `closeHooHey` clears `_hhRollTimer` so navigation mid-roll can't strand the interval.
CSS lives in `systems.css` (`.hh-die*`, `hhTumble`/`hhLand`/`hhWinBounce`/`hhShake`, reduced-motion
aware).

**Pass economy** (`awardWonderPasses` in `09-items.js`, called from `advanceToNextLevel`): first-ever
clear of a planet = **5 passes**; perfect replays (0 wrong) pay on a diminishing schedule **4 (×4) →
3 (×5) → 2 (×6) → 1** thereafter; non-perfect replays earn nothing. State: `wonderPasses`,
`passEarns`.

## Farm — `js/18-farm.js` (`#farmView`)

Crops (apple/orange/rice/wheat/corn/coffee/sugarcane) + animals (chicken/duck/sheep/pig/cow) + houses.
Growth is driven by **`state.solveClock`** (total problems solved; "1 planet" = 9 solves), **not
wall-clock**. `state.farm = { plots, animals, houses }`; `plots` is a fixed-length array (`null` =
empty owned plot) + a derived `plotCount`. Fertilizer → 9-solve crop (else 27); feed → animal grows
9 solves after feeding. **🛒 Go to Market** buys seeds(=plant)/animals/feed/fertilizer/plots/houses.
Pure helpers `cropProgress`/`animalProgress`.

## Laboratory — `js/19-alchemy.js` (`#alchemyView`)

The synthesis room (file/ids keep the internal `alchemy`/`alch-` names): `ALCHEMY_RECIPES` combine
inventory items + monster materials into **Super Medicine** (full HP/MP) and the **Acid Vial** (arms
Corrosion on the next battle — `poison_vial` id kept internally). `canCraft`/`craftRecipe`
(validate-then-spend). Bubbling-cauldron CSS.

## Item Store — `js/20-item-store.js` (`#itemStoreView`)

Sells potion/ether/moon_herb/star_dew (from `ITEMS` in `09-items.js`); a backpack "Use" section.
`buyStoreItem(id, qty)`. Consumables/ingredients live in `state.inventory` (id→count);
`countItem/addItem/spendItem/useItem` in `09-items.js`.
